<b>Yet an other gallery app</b>

From a personal point of view, an album is not just a collection of time ordered photos, they are visuals and texts organised to tell a story, to help you remember moment and feelings from the past.

The goal of this gallery app is to mimic an old fashion photo album though image spacial organisation, text and hand drawings, giving you the tools to express and store your memories ("souvenirs" in french). Well, at least trying to do it that way with my amateur android programming skills... And spice it a bit with some more "modern" items inside your album, like videos or sound/music.

<b>Album modes</b>

Album are composed of several pages where you can include image or text blocs.

There are two possible album mode available :
<ul>
<li>Tile mode : images and text blocs are organised in tiles fully covering the page. You can pan/zoom each images and handwritten annotations over them.</li>
<li>Free mode : you can resize images and blocs however you want on your page, even overlaid them. This mode need more time to design your album and generally leaves blank area that are not optimized for small smartphone. (deprecated)</li>
</ul>
