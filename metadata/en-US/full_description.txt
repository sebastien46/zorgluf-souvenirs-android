<b>Yet an other gallery app</b>

Old school paper albums are not just a collection of time ordered photos, they are visuals and texts organised to tell a story, make you remember a moment in the past.

The goal of this app is to mimic a full photo album though image spacial organisation, text and hand drawings, giving you the tools to express and store your memories ("souvenirs" in french). With a touch of more modern items such as video and sound.

Well, at least trying to do it that way with my amateur android programming skills...

<b>Album structure</b>

Album are composed of several pages where you can include image or text blocs.

Images and text blocs are organised in tiles fully covering the page. You can pan/zoom each images and handwritten annotations over them. You can also manually resize the tiles for a more custom layout.
